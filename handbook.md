# Developer's Handbook: Step-by-step Guide

Follow this guide to ensure we maintain our code quality and standards:

## 1. Plan Your Task

- Understand the requirements and specifications of the feature you're about to implement. Discuss any ambiguities or uncertainties with the team.

## 2. Git Operations

- Sync your local repository with the remote to get the latest code.
- Create a new branch for the feature you're working on, branching off from the main branch.

## 3. Write Unit Tests

- Write comprehensive unit tests for the feature you're implementing.
- Your tests should cover all edge cases and potential inputs.

## 4. Run the Tests

- Run your tests to confirm they fail (as you haven't written the feature code yet).

## 5. Write the Feature Code

- Write minimal, clean code to implement the feature and make your tests pass.
- Ensure your code follows the PEP 8 style guide and our code quality standards.

## 6. Run the Tests Again

- Run the unit tests again.
- If they pass, proceed to the next step. If they fail, debug your code and repeat the process until they pass.

## 7. Refactor Your Code

- Improve your code by refactoring it for better readability, performance, or simplicity while ensuring that it still passes the tests.

## 8. Update Terraform Scripts

- If your changes require infrastructure updates, adjust your Terraform scripts accordingly.
- Validate the changes using `terraform plan`.

## 9. Update CI/CD Pipeline Configuration

- If necessary, adjust the CI/CD pipeline configuration to accommodate your feature (e.g., new build steps, additional tests, etc.)

## 10. Commit Your Changes

- Stage and commit your changes locally.
- Write a meaningful commit message describing what was added or changed.

## 11. Push Your Changes to the Remote Repository

- Push your feature branch to the remote repository.

## 12. Open a Pull Request

- Open a pull request (PR) on the remote repository to merge your feature branch into the main branch.
- Request code reviews from your peers.

## 13. Address Code Review Feedback

- Make necessary adjustments based on code review feedback.
- Ensure that the changes pass all checks and tests in the CI/CD pipeline.

## 14. Merge Your PR

- Once your PR is approved and all tests pass, merge your changes into the main branch.
- Ensure your changes don't break the main branch by monitoring the CI/CD pipeline.

## 15. Document Your Work

- Update the code documentation as needed.
- Ensure that your feature and its functionality are adequately described.
